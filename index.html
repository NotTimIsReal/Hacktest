<h1>My Passion Project:</h1>
<p>My driving question was how can I make a website that can hack someone, I wasn't able to actually hack someone but, I was able to make a virus that will do minor damage to their computer which I have made fixable. </p>
<p>Note: For Eductaion Purposes</p>

<noscript>Well where did that go? You killed JAVA I am very sad goodbye, FYI fix it!</noscript>
<h1>What is this?</h1>
<p>This software will make your computer connect to any wifi found and type in its password for you.</p>
<h1>How does this work?</h1>
<p>it works by sending a fake ping to the wifi and that ping makes the wifi think that it is a device that they know</p>
<h1>How to use it?</h1>
<p>Simple! All you need to do is to very siply download the .bat file and run it and voila, you have free wifi!</p>
